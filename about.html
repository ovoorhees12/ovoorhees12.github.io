		<h3>Who We Are</h3>
		<p class="redText">
			We are Stony Brook University's 
			official Ultimate Frisbee team. We have a men and women's 
			team, and for several tournaments we combine to compete as a co-ed team. 
			Both teams compete in USA Ultimate's Metro East Division 1 section for a â€‹national 
			ranking. We mostly travel throughout the tri-state area for our weekend tournaments, 
			and attend 8-10 events per school year.

		<h3>Practices</h3>
		<p class="redText">
			We practice 3 times a week during both the Fall and Spring, typically either at the South P Lot fields 
			or the Campus Recreation fields. During the beginning of the Spring semester we practice indoors at the 
			Campus Recreation center due to the weather. Practice times are located on the <a href="schedule.html">Schedule</a>
			page.

		<h3>Tournaments</h3>

			We usually go to about 4 tournaments per semester, mostly in the tri-state area. During the fall we play 
			at both Men's/Women's and mixed tournaments, and during the Spring we primarily play Men's/Women's. 
			During spring break we head down to Myrtle beach with two mixed teams for the week to compete at High Tide!
